# MatMoriffer & NetShield

### About
Kernel driver (MatMoriffer) for capturing packets and GUI Application (NetShield) for communicating with it and generating charts (also CLI application)

## Purpose:
Application can be developed in the future where the new features will be: blocking packets, and more charts. The application has been developed strictly for learning purposes

## Demands
The kernel module has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 kernel version 6.2 - 6.5

## Compilation
I have written scripts that enable you to install dependencies, build and install everything on your machine to run it
```
cd scripts
sudo sh install
```

## Demands
To test program you may need to turn off Secure boot, without that kernel module may not be inserted
